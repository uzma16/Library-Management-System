# Library Management System

It is an automated system to manage a public library.Here is an admin panel for librarians to control and manage the system easily through an interactive interface. And the another panel is for student side.The system helps both students and library manager to keep a constant track of all the books available in the library. It allows both the admin and the student to search for the desired book.

## Features

- Librarians need to make an entry for new books. To automate the process they simply need to enter the number of issues, then the Issue ID for each book issue is generated automatically.
- Students can only access limited features, i.e., public access level features which include searching a book and student registration form.
- Librarians can be given their authorized login ID and password without which the system can not be accessed.
- The most important function of any library is to issue and return books. This system includes a panel to view all outstanding logs and a super simple panel to issue and return books for all librarians.
- Another responsibility of a librarian is to approve students in situations where approval is needed, i.e. where documents are to be verified or some manual work. Librarians have a panel to simply approve / reject students and to view all approved students. The librarian ID is stored alongside each approved/rejected student to keep track.
